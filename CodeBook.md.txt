The purpose of this CodeBook.md document is to describe thee variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed in the Final Project.r program.

The program first downloaded the zip file from [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

And opens it in R-studio

Then, the program opened the files, each as a data table and saved them under the following variable names:

Variables:

data\_x\_test: imported data table from the X\_test file

data\_y\_test: imported data column from the y\_test file

data\_subj\_test: imported data column from the subject\_test file

data\_x\_train: imported data table from the X\_train file

data\_y\_train: imported data column from the y\_train file

data\_subj\_train: imported data column from the subject\_train file

Next, the program creates four different subsets for building one data frame which contains all of the imported data.

sub\_y\_test: the data frame resulting from binding data\_subj\_test with data\_y\_test

sub\_y\_x\_test: the data frame resulting from binding sub\_y\_test with data\_x\_test

sub\_y\_train: the data frame resulting from binding data\_subj\_train with data\_y\_train

sub\_y\_x\_train: the data frame resulting from binding sub\_y\_xt\_test with sub\_y\_x\_train

data\_train\_test: the data frame resulting from binding sub\_y\_x\_test with sub\_y\_x\_train

Next the program imports the features file which has a table containing the variable names of the columns of our desired data frame.

feat\_tbl: the imported table from the features file

sub\_feat\_tbl: the 2nd column from the feat\_tbl variable

Next, the program sifts through each observation and identifies the rows that contain either mean() or std().

feat\_rw\_mean: a numerical value indicating the rows in the sub\_feat\_tbl containing the phrase mean().

feat\_rw\_std: a numerical value indicating the rows in the sub\_feat\_tbl containing the phrase std().

Next, the program saves the numbers from the feat\_rw\_mean and the feat\_rw\_std variables and saves those numbers as one vector. It also adds 2 to each element so that the names of each variable will line up with their accompanying data in the data\_train\_test data frame and labels.

feat\_rw\_mean\_std: a vector containing all of the values (each increased by +2) from feat\_rw\_mean and feat\_rw\_std.

Next, the program creates a subset of the data\_train\_test data frame. This subset is comprised only of the rows matching the feat\_rw\_mean\_std vector. This new data frame is labeled data\_mean\_std.

data\_mean\_std: a subset of data\_train\_test comprised of columns given selected from the column position numbers equal to the vector c(1,2,feat\_rw\_mean\_std).

Next, the program downloads the 6 labels describing each activity tested from the activity\_labels file.

labels: imported data table from the activity\_labels file.

Next, the program runs the switch\_num\_lab function which replaces the numerical value in column 2 of the data\_mean\_std with its appropriate activity description and saves the result as the variable activity.

activity: the variable name for the single column summarizing the appropriate activity description matching the numerical values from the 2nd column of the data\_mean\_std data frame.

Next, the program replaces the names of the first 2 columns of the data set data\_mean\_std with the first column being named volunteer.id.num and the 2nd column being named activity.

Next, the program creates a subset of the feat\_tbl data frame called col\_names. This subset the corresponding names from the feat\_tbl variable. It uses the vector c(feat\_rw\_mean\_std -2) in order to decide which labels to use. The -2 is because the labelling will begin with the 3rd column of the data\_mean\_std data frame.

Next, the program calls on the package data.table and uses the command setnames to replace the names of columns 3 through 81 of the data frame data\_mean\_std with the corresponding names from the col\_names subset.

Next, the program uses the gsub command to clean up the column names by clarifying all abbreviations, deleting repetition, and replacing all capital letters with lower letters instead.

Next, the program uses the ddply command to take the data\_mean\_std data frame and split the data frame into subgroups according to the volunteer.id.num and then the activity. It then finds the mean values for each column within each subgroup and combines the results into one new data frame labelled tidy\_data\_avg.

Tidy\_data\_avg: the name of the data frame summarizing the results of the means of each column, which were first split into subgroups according to the volunteer.id.num and the activity.

Finally, the program saves the tidy\_data\_avg data frame as a txt file labelled tidydata.txt.
